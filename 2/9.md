## Brace Expansion

There are two types of brace expansion:
+ String lists: {1,2,3,sarah,a,b,c}
+ Range lists: {1..1000}

1. echo {1,3,5,7} -> which mean this was part of string list
2. echo {1..10}
3. echo {10..1}
4. echo {a..z}
5. echo {1..100}
6. As you know there is a step in every range. we can use thet for increment
7. echo {1..100..**3**} -> 3 in here is like a increment
8. echo month{01..12}/day{01..30}
